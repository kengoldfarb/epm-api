Avoid using these symbols as a readability separator.\\n* Note that both [RDFa](http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-primer/#using-the-content-attribute) and Microdata syntax allow the use of a \"content=\" attribute for publishing simple machine-readable values alongside more human-friendly formatting.\\n* Use values from 0123456789 (Unicode 'DIGIT ZERO' (U+0030) to 'DIGIT NINE' (U+0039)) rather than superficially similiar Unicode symbols.\n      ",
